These are NS4 install scripts to help you download, install, run NS4 quickly.We have tested it successfully on Ubuntu 16.04.

We recommend to install NS4 step by step, because there may be some errors in the installation process.We also provide a one-click installation script(install_deps.sh) to install NS4. 

You can choose one of the following ways to install NS4.
install NS4 step by step:
1 install ns3 
bash install_ns3_pre.sh
bash install_ns3.sh
2 install bmv2
bash install_bmv2.sh
3 install p4c-bm
bash install_p4c-bm.sh

If everything goes well, you will find you are in this folder(ns-3.27),before run ns4 you need to modify a place in src/ns4/examples/p4-example.cc.

You just need to modify home_path value to your own home path.(My home path is "/home/kp"),and then just run ns4.

$ bash run.sh
If it runs successfully, you can look up the result in this file(res.txt)
$ cat res.txt
