You need to add a new user because ns4 programs rely on some file path, of course this is optional.
Then run this script to install ns4,bmv2,p4c-bm,ns4,this needs to take some time. 


$ cd /home/kphf1995cm/
$ sudo su
# bash install_deps.sh
If it goes well, then you will come to this folder(/home/kphf1995cm/ns-allinone-3.27/ns-3.27)
Then just run ns4.
$ bash run.sh
If it runs successfully, you can look up the result in this file(res.txt)
$ cat res.txt
